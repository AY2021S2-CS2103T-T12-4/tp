## 1. Welcome to imPoster

Are you an aspiring [**Application Programming Interface (API)**](#glossary-api) developer? Or would you like a peek into the world of how applications communicate with one another? Then **imPoster** is the app just for you! But hold on, what is imPoster?

imPoster is a desktop application for beginners of API development to quickly go hands-on with the basics. Whether you are looking to **explore**, **test**, or **build** your very own APIs, the simple and minimalistic style of imPoster will quickly get you up and going.

This user guide assumes that users have a **basic understanding** of APIs. If you are wondering [what an API is](#81-what-is-an-api), an appendix has been provided for users who may be unfamiliar with the concept. However, it is highly recommended for users to refer to proper tutorial contents for the basics of APIs prior to using the application.

For fast typists, imPoster is also highly optimised for the command line and can be fully operated through keyboard commands. Users who are familiar with [**CURL**](#glossary-curl) will also be happy to know that we share a very similar command line syntax. If you have yet to do so, be sure to download our [latest releases](https://imposter-dev.tk) from our main website and give us a try!

## 3. Quickstart

1. Ensure you have **Java 11 or above** installed on your Computer.

2. Download the latest **imPoster.jar** from
   [here](https://imposter-dev.tk) and move the file to the folder you wish to use as the **home folder** for imPoster.

3. **Double-click** the file to start the application. A graphical user interface (GUI) containing the annotated **3 main components** should show up as below:<br>

    <p align="center">
      <img width="900px" src="images/startscreen.png" >
    </p>

4. Try making your first API call through our application with the first [**endpoint**](#glossary-endpoint) shown in the default **Endpoint List**. Type <span class="main-command">send</span> <span class="compulsory-param">1</span> in the **Command Box** and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

5. After which, try scrolling through the responses shown in the **Result Display** as well!

6. For a quick **overview** of all available commands, please refer to our [Command Summary](#6-command-summary).

7. For the **details** of each command, please proceed to the next section on [Commands](#4-commands).

8. When you are ready to start testing your APIs, clear the default **Endpoint List** by typing <span 
   class="main-command">clear</span> in the **Command Box** and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

9. If you are new and unsure of where to find an API endpoint to start, fret not! We have prepared an extensive list of [sample endpoints](#86-sample-endpoints) for you.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
imPoster will start with an empty file if a modification to the [data file](#data-file) causes the data to be invalid.
</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. Commands

Commands are classified into 2 categories, namely **general** and **endpoint**. Before diving into the details, let us first look at what makes up a command:

| Component    | Description                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command Word | The keyword representing the action of the command                    |
| Prefix       | The keyword to recognise command parameters                           |
| Parameters   | Follows directly behind a prefix and contains the corresponding value |

As an example, a basic command to add an endpoint could look like the following:

<span class="main-command">add</span> <span class="compulsory-param">-x GET</span> <span class="compulsory-param">-u https://google.com</span>

In the example above, <span class="main-command">add</span> is the command word while <span class="compulsory-param">-x</span> and <span class="compulsory-param">-u</span> are the prefixes of the <span class="compulsory-param">GET</span> and <span class="compulsory-param">https://google.com</span> parameters respectively. For your convenience, a list of all parameters along with their prefixes and descriptions have been included in the table below. An example usage of all the parameters are also demonstrated in the [add command](#421-add-an-api-endpoint-add).

<a name="prefix-table"></a>

| Parameter    | Prefix | Description                                                           |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INDEX        |  None  | The index of the endpoint as shown in the endpoint panel list         |
| THEME        |  None  | The theme for the application                                         |
| METHOD       |   -x   | The [request method](#84-request-methods) to use for an endpoint      |
| URL          |   -u   | The URL to use for an endpoint                                        |
| HEADER       |   -h   | The header to use for an endpoint **(must be enclosed with \"\")**      |
| DATA         |   -d   | The data to use for an endpoint **(must be in [JSON](#85-json-format) format)**          |
| TAG          |   -t   | The tag to label an endpoint                 |

Here are some general rules to follow when entering prefixes and parameters:
* A whitespace must be included before every prefix.<br>
  e.g. `-x METHOD-u URL` is not acceptable, and ` -x METHOD -u URL` is in the correct format.<br>
  
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If the command specifies `-x METHOD -u URL`, `-u URL -x METHOD` is also acceptable.<br>
  
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. If you specify `-u https://github.com/ -u https://google.com/`, only `-u https://google.com/` will be taken.<br>
  
* To add multiple parameters of the same prefix, add the prefix multiple times before each parameter.<br>
  e.g. To add two TAGs, enter `-t tagOne -t tagTwo`.<br>
  e.g. To add three HEADERs, enter `-h "header: one" -h "header: two" -h "header: three"`.<br>
  
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.<br>

* Multiple headers/tags must be unique and duplicates will be ignored.
  e.g. `edit 1 -t tag -t tag` will only create one `tag`.

About the URL Parameter:
* We do not check the validity of the URLs during input as it is impossible to verify if it exists without sending a request to the server. We will instead prevent impossible URL from being keyed in. e.g. `abc.com\go` (`\` cannot exist in a valid URL)

* If no website [protocol](#glossary-protocol) is specified, we enforce a HTTP protocol as a protocol needs to be specified for an API request to be carried out.For instance, if a user enters `google.com` as a URL, we will prepend the URL with `http://`, making it `http://google.com`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q**: I am completely new to APIs, how do I get an [endpoint](#glossary-endpoint)?
<br/><br/>
**A**: While the use of APIs is commonplace, not all applications provide their API endpoints publicly. **Google** is your best friend for searching of public APIs but if you are new and just looking to try things out, fear not! We have prepared an extensive list of [sample endpoints](#86-sample-endpoints) to get you started!

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
<br/><br/> 
**A**: Install the application in the other computer and place your current data folder in the same directory as the newly installed application (overwrite the data folder of the new application if applicable).

**Q**: How can I send non-JSON data in the request body?
<br/><br/>
**A**: This current version of imPoster only supports the sending of [JSON](#85-json-format) data in the request body which is the format used by an estimated over 70% of APIs worldwide. We apologise for the inconvenience caused but we are happy to share that plans are in place to include support for other data formats in future versions!

<a name="data-file"></a>
**Q**: Where are the data of imPoster saved?
<br/><br/>
**A**: imPoster data are saved automatically after every command into a JSON file named `imposter.json`. This file is stored within the `data` folder in the same location as the application `JAR` file and is created after the initial launch (and a command execution) of a fresh installation.

### 8.1 What is an API?

Broadly speaking, an **API** is an interface that enables and defines how **two systems** interact with one another. In a classic analogy, the interaction above is usually likened to a **waiter** communicating a **customer** order to the restaurant **kitchen**. In this analogy, the **customer** and **kitchen** represents the **two systems**, and the **waiter** represents the **API** allowing them to communicate. The **order** and **food** delivered then corresponds to the terms **request** and **response** associated with an API call. The annotated diagram below captures these interactions and may aid in providing a better understanding:

</p>

Note that for the **waiter** to pass the order to the **kitchen**, a **window/door** is required to allow communication and this is represented by the term [**endpoint**](#glossary-endpoint) which is frequently used in relation to an API.

### 8.2 Why learn about APIs?

You may be surprised to know that APIs are not only widely used in our daily lives, it is also likely that you have been using them frequently without actually noticing them! For example, the simple act of visiting a website involves an API request which is responsible for bringing back a response to you in the form of a webpage. Even a simple text message to your friend relies on an API to reliably deliver your message! APIs are used extensively in our world today so even if they are unrelated to your job, it helps to have some basic understanding of them!

### 8.3 What are requests and responses?

The terms **requests** and **responses** both refer to messages used in the exchange of information between two systems (sender and receiver). Typically, the sender will send out a request containing information to be sent to the receiver. Then, when the receiver receives the request from the sender, it will process the request and send back a response. This response is then received and processed by the original sender, thus completing a single API call.

### 8.4 Request Methods
As of the latest version of our application, we support 7 commonly used request methods. We recommend individuals who are interested to learn more about request types to refer to [official documentation](https://webconcepts.info/concepts/http-method/). A brief explanation for the 7 supported requests have been provided below:

| Method      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**     | Retrieves information from a server through a specified URL                  |
| **POST**    | Sends data to a server, commonly in JSON/html form format           |
| **PUT**     | Sends data to a server, commonly in JSON/html form format      |
| **DELETE**  | Removes information from a server through a specified URL             |
| **HEAD**    | Similar to GET, but returns only the header section of the response                                         |
| **PATCH**   | Sends data to a server, commonly in JSON/html form format |
| **OPTIONS** | Retrieves the allowed communication options (methods) for a specified URL                                   |

### 8.5 JSON Format
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation and is a common lightweight format for data storage (in the form of key/value pairs). In an API call, the JSON format is also commonly used to send data between two systems. For the current version of our application, JSON is the only format supported for sending data. The following are some examples of data in JSON format:
- `{}` - represents an empty JSON data
- `{"name": "john doe"}` - represents a single level JSON data 
- `{"persons": {"name": "john doe"}}` - represents a nested JSON data

### 8.6 Sample Endpoints

An extensive list of sample endpoints have been provided below for new users to test and try out. Note that the **header** field has been omitted in the samples to keep them beginner friendly but rest assured that the following **sample endpoints will work without the header** field. That said, for those more familiar with APIs, some examples of headers have been included in the initial list of default endpoints that came with the JAR file. For the even more adventurous, you may refer to and explore the [full list of HTTP headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields). 

Data fields on the other hand have been included in a standalone column (if applicable). They are all in the [**JSON format**](#85-json-format) and only the keys are provided (you may play around with your own values). The sample endpoints below are organised according to their [request method types](#84-request-methods) for your convenience. Go ahead and try out the sample endpoints below!
