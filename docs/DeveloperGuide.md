### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app


### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a …​                                    | I want to …​                     | So that I can…​                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `* * *`  | new user                                   | see usage instructions         | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App                 |
| `* * *`  | user                                       | add a new person               |                                                                        |

| `* *`    | user                                       | hide private contact details   | minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident                |
| `*`      | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name           | locate a person easily                                                 |

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
