## **Introduction**
imPoster is a desktop application for beginners of API development to quickly grasp the basics. 
imPoster's simple and minimalistic style can help beginner API developers **explore** and **test** APIs, whether those **found online** or those that they have **built** themselves.
imPoster is also highly optimised fast typists and can be fully operated through keyboard commands. <br>

This developer's guide assumes its readers to have a **basic understanding** of APIs. 
For a basic definition of [what an API is](#what-is-an-api), an appendix has been provided for readers who may be unfamiliar with the concept.
However, it is highly recommended for readers to refer to proper tutorial contents for the basics of APIs prior to developing the application. <br>

Readers are also advised to download our [latest releases](https://imposter-dev.tk) from our main website in order to test out the application. <br>

## **Navigating this Developer Guide**

Before diving into the rest of the contents in our developer guide, the following are a few important syntaxes to take note of to facilitate your reading:

## **Design**
### Architecture

![Architecture_Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/Main.java) and [`ImPoster`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/ImPoster.java). They are responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramRemove.png" width="600" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EndpointListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in 
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component
![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ImposterParser` class to parse the user command
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a endpoint).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remove 1")` API call.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/RemoveSequenceDiagram.png)

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the Endpoint List Data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Endpoint>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model
is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `imPoster`, which `Endpoint` references. This allows `imPoster` to only 
require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Endpoint` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/us/among/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Endpoint List data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.us.among.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Endpoint Components
* Change/Add classes in the Endpoint package to encapsulate an API endpoint.
#### Implementation
![Structure of the Model Component](images/EndpointClassDiagram.png)
An `Endpoint`,
* is stored in `EndpointList` of the `Model`
* encapsulates an API endpoint

An `Endpoint` contains the following attributes:
1. a `Method`, which represents the type of request an API endpoint will send to the server
2. an `Address`, which represents the URL address to which the API request is made
3. a `Data`, which represents the data that is to be sent to the server when an API request is made
4. a Headers Set, which encapsulates a list of zero or more `Header` objects, where each `Header` represents a header that is to be sent to the server
5. a Tags Set, which encapsulates a list of zero or more `Tags` objects
6. a `Response`, which represents the response that an API receives from the server

* There are a certain set of requests that an API can make: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH.
* A `Method` object will always be one of the above requests
* `Data` represents the data that is to be sent to the server when an API request is made
* `Data` can be empty, as some API calls do not send any data to the server
* Before an API call is made, the `Response` object will be empty
* Only when a Request#executeTimed(request) is called will a `Response` contain information about the API call response

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes how an endpoint is created when a user executes an add command:
![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect: How the components within `Endpoint` are added or changed
* **Current Choice**: Attributes within `Endpoint` are immutable, meaning that if there is an attribute that has to be
  edited or added, a new Endpoint object has to be created.
    * Pros: Concept of Immutability is met, making the code less prone to bugs as all components of an Endpoint object are fixed
    * Cons: Less flexible, more steps needed in creating or editing Endpoint objects

* **Alternative 1**: Allow certain components within `Endpoint`, like `Header` and `Data` to be mutable
    * Pros: Less overhead as fewer objects are created
    * Cons: Prone to error as a Component might not be correctly changed
    
### Add endpoint feature

#### What it is

Adds an endpoint to the bottom of the list of currently existing endpoints. Users are able to add any valid endpoint to the list. If the exact same endpoint is already in the list, this command will not be allowed and an error will be shown.

Example: `add -x get -u https://localhost:3000`

#### Implementation

Upon the users entry of the endpoint, the `AddCommand` object is created. `AddCommand` is a class that extends `Command` abstract class. `AddCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the method will add the given endpoint in the model's list of endpoints if a valid endpoint is given.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `add -x get -u https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/air-temperature` to save an endpoint.

Step 2. The endpoint is added to the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:
![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Find command feature

#### What it is

Looks for an endpoint in the list of endpoints and displays all the endpoints that match the requested specifications. If there are no specifications, `find` will do a general search through all fields that endpoint has.

#### Implementation

Upon the users entry of the find keyword, the parser will check if prefixes have been specified, if the user decided to specify prefixes, the `FindCommand` object will be created with predicates looking through the specified prefixes. Else, a general endpoint predicate that will scan through all fields of endpoint will be created. `FindCommand` is a class that extends `Command` abstract class. `FindCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the method will search through the given endpoints in the model's list of endpoints and check if any endpoints match the specifications. It will then update the model with the filtered endpoint list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `find -x get -u https://localhost:3000` to find an endpoint.

Step 2. The find command will check and see if there are any endpoints that contain the method `get` and the address `https://localhost:3000` using the `Model#updateFilteredEndpointList` method.

Step 3. `Model#updateFilteredEndpointList` will be called and model will be updated.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `find get` will work as well, but will look through all fields instead of just one
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" alt="FindActivityDiagram" width="450px" />
</p>

### Send/run command feature

#### What it is

Allows the user to make an API call to a specific endpoint, either with values from a saved endpoint (`send`) or values passed in as command line arguments (`run`).

#### Implementation

The send/run mechanism is very involved in the invocation of an actual outbound request that is facilitated by the `request` package. Both commands allow users to get the latest response from an endpoint and display the result for inspection.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the send command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `add -x get -u https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/environment/air-temperature` to save an endpoint (a `get` request to the API URL address above).

Step 2. The user executes `send 1` command to first retrieve the endpoint stored at index 1. The endpoint at that index will then be used to generate an `EndpointCaller` object.

Step 3. The `send` command calls `EndpointCaller#callEndpoint()`, sending out the HTTP request to the targeted API service provider and retrieves a response. The existing endpoint used to invoke the request will be used to generate an updated endpoint with the returned response and saved into the model.

Step 4. The response retrieved will also be parsed and passed to UI for further formatting and displaying to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a send command fails its execution, it will not call `model.setEndpoint()`, so the endpoint list state will not be updated or saved.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the send operation works:
![SendSequenceDiagram](images/SendSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SendCommand` should end 
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `run` command deploys a similar trick but for an endpoint specified directly within the command arguments.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a run command:
<p align="center">
  <img alt="RunActivityDiagram" src="images/RunActivityDiagram.png" width="400px"/>
</p>
#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How send & run executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The Send and Run command parsers verify the validity of endpoint/url address before generating the respective commands.
    * Pros: Keep the checking logic within the same place.
    * Cons: It may not be clear if the command contains a valid endpoint.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command checks if the endpoint/url address is valid by itself.
    * Pros: Checking of url address validity right before execution will ensure proper request is processed.
    * Cons: Duplication of code across Send and Run commands.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Request feature

#### What it is

Supports the core functionality of our product which involves the sending of requests and receiving of responses from a specified endpoint. Required by the `send` and `run` command to perform API calls as requested by the user.

#### Implementation

The request mechanism is invoked by the `EndpointCaller` object when the user executes a send/run command and is facilitated by the `Apache HttpComponents` library. When invoked, it performs an API call to a specific endpoint and returns a response if the call is performed successfully. It supports API calls for the following methods, each represented by a class:
- `GET`
- `PUT`
- `POST`
- `DELETE`
- `HEAD`
- `OPTIONS`
- `PATCH`

Given below is an example usage scenario where the behaviour of request mechanism is captured in step 3.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time which comes with a default list of endpoints.

Step 2. The user executes `send 1` command to first retrieve the endpoint stored at index 1 (`GET` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/readme`). The endpoint at that index will then be used to generate an `EndpointCaller` object.

Step 3. The `send` command calls `EndpointCaller#callEndpoint()`, which in turn calls `EndpointCaller#sendRequest`. Next, a `GetRequest` object is created for the associated endpoint and its `send` method is invoked. Following this, a `HttpUriRequest` object is created and `Headers` and `Data` fields are populated with values retrieved from the endpoint. Finally, the `#execute` method from the abstract `Request` class is called and a timed execution of the API call is carried out to the targeted API service provider. A response is returned and the existing endpoint used to invoke the request will be updated with the returned response and saved into the model.

Step 4. The response retrieved will also be parsed and passed to UI for further formatting and displaying to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If an API call fails to return a response (e.g. due to connection error), it will not call `model.setEndpoint()` so the endpoint list state will not be updated or saved.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the request operation works when a user executes a `send` command for an endpoint with a `GET` request:
<p align="centre">
  <img alt="SendSequenceDiagram" src="images/RequestSequenceDiagram.png"/>
</p>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SendCommand`, `EndpointCaller` and `GetRequest` should end 
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `send` command for an endpoint with a `GET` request:
<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="RequestActivityDiagram" src="images/RequestActivityDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How request executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The request class executes the API call and differentiates types of exceptions into multiple catch blocks.
    * Pros: Error messages are specific enough to help the user debug the error.
    * Cons: Individual exceptions have to be verified thoroughly to ensure that error messages do not mislead the user.

* **Alternative 2:** The request class executes the API call and catches all exceptions together in one catch block.
    * Pros: Most if not all instances of failed API calls are caught.
    * Cons: Error message is not specific enough to help the user debug the error.

### Toggle command feature

#### What it is

Allows the user to switch between supported themes (colour palettes) within the product.

#### Implementation

Upon entry of the toggle command, it is parsed to check if the input theme is valid (ie. among the list of available themes). If it is valid, a `ToggleCommand` is created. `ToggleCommand` is a class that extends the `Command` class and hence also inherits the `execute()` method. When `execute()` is called, it will set the theme of the application to be the input theme.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the toggle command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `toggle light` to change the application theme to the light theme.

Step 2. The `toggle` command returns a `CommandResult` that triggers the `updateTheme()` method within `MainWindow`. `MainWindow` then finds the relevant .css file containing all theme information and applies it to all elements it contains.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the toggle command works for the above example: 
![ToggleSequenceDiagram](images/ToggleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ToggleCommand`, `ToggleCommandParser` and `CommandResult` should end 
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

## **Appendix D: Non-Functional Requirements**

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above
    installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 API endpoints without a noticeable
    sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not
    code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the
    tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should feel simple and easy to use as compared to existing
    solutions such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
5.  Should be able to provide a proper response even if a call to an API
    endpoint fails due to third-party unavailability.
6.  Should not crash or throw unexpected errors when internet connection is
    unavailable.
7.  Should be able to display responses not exceeding 100000 characters from an
    API call without crashing or throwing unexpected errors.

the adopted approach in maintaining imPoster.

## **Appendix G: API definition**

### What is an API?
Broadly speaking, an **API** is an interface that enables and defines how **two systems** interact with one another.Â In a classic analogy, the interaction above is usually likened to a **waiter** communicating a **customer** order to the restaurant **kitchen**. In this analogy, the **customer** and **kitchen** represents the **two systems** and the **waiter** represents the **API** allowing them to communicate. The **order** and **food** delivered then corresponds to the terms **request** and **response** associated with an API call. The annotated diagrams below capture these interactions and may aid in providing a better understanding:

</p>

### Why learn about APIs?

You may be surprised to know that APIs are not only widely used in our daily lives, it is also likely that you have been using them frequently without actually noticing them! For example, the simple act of visiting a website involves an API request which is responsible for bringing back a response to you in the form of a webpage. Even a simple text message to your friend relies on an API to reliably deliver your message! The use of APIs is extensive in todayâ€™s highly connected world so even if they are completely unrelated to your job, it helps to have some basic understanding of them!

## **Appendix H: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on and testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file. <br>
      Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample endpoints. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. Exiting the app
   
   1. With the app still open, enter `exit` in the command box or click on the close window button.<br>
      Expected: App closes.

### Deleting an endpoint

1. Deleting an endpoint while all endpoints are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all endpoints using the `list` command. Multiple endpoints in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First endpoint is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted endpoint shown in the result display.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No endpoint is deleted. Error details shown in the result display.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Saving data

1. Saving endpoints between sessions
   
   1. Launch the app.
      
   1. Save an endpoint with a valid `add` command. Confirm the endpoint has been saved by checking its existence at the end of the list of saved endpoints.
      
   1. Close the app.
      
   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      Expected: The new endpoint is still present at the end of the list of saved endpoints. 

1. Dealing with corrupted/missing data files

   1. Prerequisite: Have opened and closed the application and confirmed that the files `preferences.json` and `data/imposter.json` have been created in the same directory that imPoster was run from.
      
   1. Manually edit any of the aforementioned files with any text editing software to break the JSON format. For example, removing the opening curly brace of the JSON file. Alternatively, you may delete these files.
      
   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
    
   1. Test case: `data/imposter.json` was corrupted/deleted. <br>
      Expected: The app should start with a list of saved endpoints (on the left) that is empty.
      
   1. Test case: `preferences.json` was corrupted/deleted. <br>
      Expected: The app should start with the default theme, window size and location.
