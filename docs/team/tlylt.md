### Project: imPoster

imPoster is a desktop application for beginners of API development to easily grasp the basics. The application is optimised for fast typists and can be fully operated through a Command Line Interface. My contributions to the project are as listed below:

#### New Features & Enhancements

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to send a request without saving the endpoint.

  - What it does: allows the user to run API requests on the fly. 
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a
    user can quickly type in an API URL with specifying details, and the app 
    will conveniently trigger a request for the user to view the response.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands that triggers an outbound
    request. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
    The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing
    commands and how we verify the validity of URLs.

- **New Feature**: Added a keyboard shortcut that allows the user to retrieve 
  the previous valid command using ctrl + up-arrow (Windows) / cmd + up-arrow (Mac).

- **New Feature**: Added a help command that allows the user to open a pop up window displaying
   relevant links such as the product's user guide and also a table of command summary. 

- **New Feature**: Added a show command that allows the user to view the details of a saved endpoint.

- **Project management**:

  - Managed releases `v1.4` on GitHub

- **Enhancements to existing features**:

  - Updated various custom feedback messages in the result display for commands
  - Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage.

- **Documentation**:

  - User Guide:
    - Added the documentation for the features `send`, `run` and `help`.

  - Developer Guide:
    - Added the high level overview of product design 
      (Architecture, UI component and Logic component)
    - Added implementation details of the `send` & `run` feature.
