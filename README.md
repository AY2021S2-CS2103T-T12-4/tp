### Introduction

imPoster contains most of the features of [postman](https://www.postman.com/) and is implemented in a simple and
minimalistic style that is easy for anyone to pick up. The latest releases for
download are available
[here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/releases).

### Features

imPoster runs locally on your computer and simplifies the process of building an
API. We offer support for the following tasks:

1. Sending and Receiving requests.
2. Saving requests to be used again later.
3. Testing requests.

For more details on the features and their usage, please refer to the
